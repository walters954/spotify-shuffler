# Product Requirements Document: Spotify Playlist Shuffler

## 1. Overview

The Spotify Playlist Shuffler is a web application designed to let users quickly shuffle the order of tracks in a selected Spotify playlist. Using Spotify’s API and a straightforward OAuth login, the app will authenticate the user, retrieve their playlists, and then create (or update) a shuffled version of the selected playlist on the user’s Spotify account. The new playlist will be named "Shuffled [Original Playlist Name]". No user data will be stored in a database; session data can be managed via secure cookies if needed.

## 2. Objectives

-   **Streamline Playlist Management:** Allow users to effortlessly shuffle any of their Spotify playlists.
-   **Prevent Duplicate Shuffles:** Ensure that repeatedly shuffling the same playlist does not create multiple playlists. Instead, the app updates the existing shuffled playlist.
-   **Secure and Fast Login:** Implement a quick, secure OAuth login with Spotify.
-   **Simple, Responsive UI:** Build the front end using Next.js, shadcn components, and Tailwind CSS for a modern, accessible design.

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1. Authentication

-   **Spotify OAuth Integration:**
    -   Enable secure and fast authentication using Spotify’s OAuth flow.
    -   Obtain necessary permissions to read user playlists and create/update playlists on behalf of the user.

### 3.2. Playlist Retrieval & Selection

-   **Fetch User Playlists:**
    -   Once authenticated, fetch and display the user’s available playlists.
    -   Provide a clean, searchable list for ease of selection.
-   **Playlist Selection UI:**
    -   Allow users to select a playlist they wish to shuffle.
    -   Display relevant details such as playlist name, number of tracks, and cover image.

### 3.3. Shuffling and Playlist Management

-   **Track Shuffling:**

    -   Randomly reorder the tracks of the selected playlist.
    -   Utilize a reliable shuffling algorithm to ensure true randomness.

-   **Duplicate Handling:**

    -   Check if a shuffled version of the playlist already exists (using a naming convention "Shuffled [Original Playlist Name]" or a stored underlying ID in secure cookies).
    -   If found, update the existing playlist; if not, create a new one.

-   **Playlist Creation/Update:**
    -   Use Spotify’s API endpoints to create or update the playlist.
    -   Ensure the new or updated playlist is immediately available in the user’s Spotify account.

### 3.4. Session & Data Management

-   **No Database Storage:**
    -   Avoid storing user data in a persistent database.
    -   Use secure cookies to store any session-related data or identifiers (such as mapping between the original and shuffled playlists).

## 4. User Flow

1. **Login:**

    - User visits the application.
    - User is prompted to log in using their Spotify account via OAuth.

2. **Playlist Retrieval:**

    - Upon authentication, the app retrieves the user’s playlists using the Spotify API.
    - The playlists are displayed in a clean UI built with shadcn components and styled with Tailwind CSS.

3. **Playlist Selection:**

    - User selects a playlist they want to shuffle.
    - The app displays details about the selected playlist for confirmation.

4. **Shuffle Process:**

    - The app shuffles the order of tracks.
    - It checks for an existing "Shuffled [Original Playlist Name]" playlist.
        - If it exists, it updates this playlist with the new track order.
        - If not, it creates a new playlist with the shuffled tracks.

5. **Confirmation & Feedback:**
    - The user receives confirmation that their shuffled playlist has been created/updated.
    - Optionally, the app can display a link to open the newly shuffled playlist directly in Spotify.

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1. Frontend

-   **Framework:** Next.js
-   **UI Components:** shadcn (or similar component library)
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
-   **State Management:** React Context or similar solution for handling authentication state and playlist data.

### 5.2. Backend & API Integration

-   **Authentication:**
    -   Implement Spotify OAuth 2.0 flow.
    -   Use secure cookies for session management.
-   **Spotify API Integration:**
    -   Retrieve user playlists.
    -   Create new playlists.
    -   Update playlists by replacing the track order.
-   **Error Handling:**
    -   Provide clear error messages for failed API calls.
    -   Handle rate limits and token expiration gracefully.

### 5.3. Security

-   **Session Security:**
    -   Use secure cookies to store session data.
    -   Ensure that OAuth tokens are handled securely and not persisted beyond the session.
-   **Data Privacy:**
    -   No user data stored in a database; all operations are transient and managed within the session.

## 6. Non-functional Requirements

-   **Performance:**
    -   Fast load times for retrieving and displaying playlists.
    -   Efficient shuffling algorithm to handle large playlists without noticeable delay.
-   **Scalability:**
    -   Designed for individual users with low concurrent usage; minimal scaling considerations required.
-   **Usability:**

    -   Intuitive user interface with clear instructions.
    -   Responsive design for mobile and desktop use.

-   **Maintainability:**
    -   Well-documented code.
    -   Adherence to best practices in Next.js and React development.
-   **Error & Exception Management:**
    -   Robust error logging.
    -   Clear, user-friendly error messages in case of API failures.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

-   **Authentication:**
    -   User can log in with Spotify and the session is maintained securely via cookies.
-   **Playlist Retrieval:**

    -   User’s playlists are fetched and displayed correctly upon login.

-   **Shuffling:**

    -   When a playlist is selected, the tracks are shuffled in a random order.
    -   The new playlist is named "Shuffled [Original Playlist Name]".

-   **Duplicate Prevention:**

    -   If the same playlist is shuffled multiple times, the app either updates the existing shuffled playlist or reuses it without creating duplicates.

-   **Error Handling:**
    -   The application gracefully handles errors (e.g., network issues, API failures) with appropriate user feedback.

## 8. Future Enhancements

-   **Custom Shuffle Options:**
    -   Provide users with options to apply different shuffling algorithms or criteria.
-   **Playlist Management:**

    -   Allow users to manage multiple shuffled versions or revert to the original order.

-   **Enhanced UI/UX:**
    -   Integrate more detailed playlist analytics or visualizations.
-   **User Preferences:**
    -   Store minimal user preferences (using secure cookies) for a more personalized experience without compromising data privacy.
